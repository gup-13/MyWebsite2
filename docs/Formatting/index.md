# How to write to the website

To write a side-menu, the following is needed:
```
title: <the name of the menu>
layout: {home, default, minimal}
nav_order: <the order of the item in the sidebar. This is a floating point number>
parent: <the name of the parent directory>?
grand_parent: <the name of the parent's parent directory>?

```
